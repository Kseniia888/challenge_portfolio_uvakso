# Task 1: software configuration.

## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?


Hello, dear everyone)

I decided to take part in a project to become Quality engineer because I wanted it for a long time but had no possibility because of work and family opportunities.  
Also, I am currently in Poland due to the war in Ukraine and I need to find a job that can support me and my family.
My goal is to gain knowledge and skills that will allow me to start a career as a junior quality engineer. 
I expect from this project the acquired knowledge and opportunities for further employment.

Best regards,
Kseniia
